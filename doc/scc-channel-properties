- Auxiliary properties required for each channel:

clocks contains the desired contents of WR11 for each channel.

clock-freq is the frequency of the clock input/crystal, in hertz.

ch-*-brg-src controls the source for the BRG (for WR14) for each channel.
 0: BRG source is the RTxC pin or XTAL (depending on the MSB of ch-*-clocks)
 1: BRG source is PCLK

wait/req controls the wait/request interface to the SCC; specifically, it is the
 high 3 bits of WR1.
