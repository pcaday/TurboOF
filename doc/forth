: c>f$-max		( cstring maxlen -- addr len )

 Unpacks a null-terminated string into a Forth string,
 searching at most maxlen bytes for a terminating character.
 

: f>c$-max		( addr len dest-addr dest-size -- len-actual )

 Packs a Forth string as a null-terminated string into the buffer
 at dest-addr with size dest-size. If there is not enough room to
 store the complete string, as much as possible is stored, and the
 terminator char is not added. len-actual returns the number of
 characters (not including the terminator) that were stored.
