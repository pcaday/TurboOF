PPC-CI notes
------------

¥ This implementation does NOT invoke the translate callback on DSI/ISI in
the User Interface in Virtual Mode as the PPC platform binding requires.
To invoke the callback would require turning translation on, which quite
possibly would cause another DSI/ISI. Instead, the DSI/ISI handlers will
always throw an error directly to Forth, even in the case of HTAB spills.

¥ The flag install-ath-w/-ints? (Forth), if set,
allows for a modification of the behavior of 'enter' in Virtual Mode when a
mapping callback has been defined. When set, 'enter' calls save-ath/install-ath/
restore-ath if a mapping callback has not been defined, in addition to
install-ints/restore-ints



possible (go-from-exception) implementation notes:

	¥ ppc-core-flat: implement returning to client after cx, needs a new swapdesc or
can share with callback_swapdesc
	¥ ppc-core-flat: cx_return: consider loading SRR1 (the client's new MSR) from the
MSR field of the client context, not the SRR1 field.
