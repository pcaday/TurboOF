Catch-Throw Frame Format (version: 26)
======================================

A catch-throw frame consists of (in order):
	- temporary rstack space (at least one cell)
	- catch handler pointer
	- (except for default catch) 3 cells of saved data
		(dstack, my-self, next frame)
	
[--temporary rstack--] handler-xt [saved-dstack saved-my-self next-frame-ptr]
                      ^
					  |
				frame pointer

The top frame pointer is stored in last-ef.


There are two catch handlers:
	default-catch				always installed
	>catch						installed by catch
